This is a bot for Telegram through which you can order the company's services. The algorithm is as follows: the user selects a category, then selects a service from this category, when ordering, the order is sent to a private group of employees to which the bot must be added in order for it to be able to send messages.
## List of features:
- Language change
- Switch to chat with support 
- Go to the group with feedback 

## Things that can be added:
- Admin Panel
- Saving orders in the database
- Order status
- Table of employees to which orders will be assigned
- etc.
